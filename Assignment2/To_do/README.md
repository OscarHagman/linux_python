# Simple to-do app

### To-do python program and a shell script that turns the local python 3 applications to a command for linux

##### To install, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the py_to_cmd.sh by typing ". py_to_cmd.sh"
3. The script will ask you to enter a command name for the to-do program. Whatever you enter will be the command name to run the script.
4. Once you have entered the command name you can call for the program to run by entering your custom command in the terminal

###### All your to-do's will be saved to a to_do.pickle file in the same directory you were in when you called for the command. It can only read the .pickle file if the file is in the same directory you are in when you're calling on the command. So don't delete or move it if you want keep your to-do's intact.
